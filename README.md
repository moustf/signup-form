## ♦ Why this form?

This form is an imaginary signup form for my future personal website, also to practice also form validation with regex.

## ♦ User journey:
- When the user first opens the singup form page, he/she will find a text that tells a digest about the website which contains a heading, and a list of the sections of the website.
- Then, the user will find the form which begins with the 'Create account:' heading and four input fields: 
  - Username field.
  - Email field.
  - Password field.
  - Confirm password field.
- And the form ends with a submit button called "singup".
