## â™¦ Live link:
check it out from **[HERE](https://moustf.github.io/signup-form/)**.

## â™¦ Why this form?

This form is an imaginary signup form for my future personal website, also to practice also form validation with regex.

## â™¦ User journey:
- When the user first opens the singup form page, he/she will find a text that tells a digest about the website which contains a heading, and a list of the sections of the website.
- Then, the user will find the form which begins with the 'Create account:' heading and four input fields: 
  - Username field.
  - Email field.
  - Password field.
  - Confirm password field.
- And the form ends with a submit button called "singup".

## â™¦ User stories:
- As a user, I should be able to see the text section which contains a title and a short list of website's sections.
- As a user, I should be able to type my username in the username input field.
- As a user, I should be able to type my email in the email input field.
- As a user, I should be able to type my password in the password input field.
- As a user, I should be able to confirm my password in the confirm password input field.
- As a user, I should be able to check my username's and email's inputs validation.
- As a user, I should be able to get my two password checked for mathcing or not matching.
- As a user, I should be able to create an account by hitting the signup button.
